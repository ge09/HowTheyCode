# HowTheyCode


A small proyect built during the GE09 event at Tolosa.

It's a software development company search app, where you can se how well (or bad) do they work depending on some surveys employees or ex-employees fill (<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html" target="_blank">Joel's test</a>). If your company is not registered, you can create it and take the survey yourself. If it is already registered, just go and answer the questions.

Pending work:
- [X] Add an 'about this' section explaining what the app is.
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Captchas
- [ ] add location based search and map visualization (CartoDB)
- [ ] improve company score measurement algorithm (date-score relationship is causing some problems)
