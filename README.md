# HowTheyCode


A small proyect built during the GE09 event at Tolosa.

It's a software development company search app, where you can se how well (or bad) do they work depending on some surveys (Joel's test). If your company is not registered, you can create it and take the survey yourself, of if it is registered, just go and answer the questions.

Pending work:
- [ ] Add an 'about this' explaining what the app is.
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Captchas
- [ ] secure api headers
- [ ] add location based search and map visualization
- [ ] improve company score measurement algorithm (date-score relationship is causing some problems)
